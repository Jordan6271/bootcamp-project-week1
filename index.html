            <h2>What is the GitHub Workflow?</h2>
                <h3>What is a commit?</h3>
                <p>A commit is when a change to a file or set of files is saved onto the branch. Each commit has it's own hash ID and can be individually identified at any point in time in order to verify exactly when each bit of code was added to the project.</p>
                <h3>What is a branch?</h3>
                <p>When a branch is created in Git, it means that all the current code is copied to a local version of the codebase. This allows people to make changes to a file they have been working on without the unfinished changes affecting the workflow of other people on the team. When the changes have been fully completed, the branch can be merged back into the original codebase (usually on the main or master branch), and at that point everyone else can pull the changes down to their versions of the codebase and have the working updates.</p>
                <h3>What is a pull request?</h3>
                <p>A pull request is essentially a notification to your team that you would like them to have a look at the changes made to the code so far in your branch. This can either be with the intent of then merging the changes in, or getting feedback in order to make the changes even better. After a pull request is opened, members of the team can comment and collaborate about whether the changes are up to par with expectations, and if not, extra commits can be added by other people on the team (or yourself). Once a pull request has been approved, it can then be merged into the 'main' or 'master' branch, and the branch it stems from can also be closed off and deleted.</p>
