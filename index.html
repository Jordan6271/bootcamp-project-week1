            <h2>What is the GitHub Workflow?</h2>

                <h3>What is a commit?</h3>
                <p>A <b>commit</b> is when a change to a file or set of files is saved onto the branch. Each commit has its own hash ID and can be individually identified at any point in time in order to verify exactly when each bit of code was added to the project.</p>

                <h3>What is a branch?</h3>
                <p>When a <b>branch</b> is created in Git, it means that all the current code is copied to a local version of the codebase. This allows people to make changes to a file they have been working on without the unfinished changes affecting the workflow of other people on the team. When the changes have been fully completed, the branch can be merged back into the original codebase (usually on the <i>main</i> or <i>master</i> branch), and at that point everyone else can pull the changes down to their versions of the codebase and have the working updates.</p>

                <h3>What is a pull request?</h3>
                <p>A <b>pull request</b> is essentially a notification to your team that you would like them to have a look at the changes made to the code so far in your branch. This can either be with the intent of then merging the changes in, or getting feedback in order to make the changes even better. After a pull request is opened, members of the team can comment and collaborate about whether the changes are up to par with expectations, and if not, extra commits can be added by other people on the team (or yourself). Once a pull request has been approved, it can then be merged into the 'main' or 'master' branch, and the branch it stems from can also be closed off and deleted.</p>
                
                <h3>Any other information about Git?</h3>
                <p><b>Git</b> can be used locally from the command line or via a GUI, such as GitHub Desktop. From either of these, the changes made to your local code can be pushed to a remote repository. There are a few websites that handle the remote part of Git, one being <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub">github.com</a> and another being <a href="https://bitbucket.org" title="Bitbucket">bitbucket.org</a>. These remote repositories are where other members of the team can view the code, and is also usually where the <i>main</i> or <i>master</i> branch lives.</p>

                <h3>How do you list the files in a directory?</h3>
                <p>The command to list the files that exist in your current directory is <b>ls</b>. Files from other directories can be listed by typing <b>ls [path to directory]</b>, for example <b>ls /Desktop/Work</b> will list all the contents of the <i>Work</i> folder on your desktop. Flags can also be added to the parameters of the search, which allows you to define extra options for the items listed. One example is <b>ls -a</b>, which will list all files, including hidden files starting with just a dot, such as the hidden <i>.git</i> file that is created when making a folder a git repository. <br>These can be combined as such: <b>ls -a /Desktop/Work</b>. A further list of flags that can be added to the <b>ls</b> command can be found <a href="https://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php" title="Unix Commands - ls">here.</a></p>
